# Geigerino

## About
Geigerino is an attempt to build a simple Geiger-MÃ¼ller detector using an Arduino Nano as the main microcontroller. Keep in mind that changing the folders structure (classes and .ino files in app folder) might throw errors when compiling.
The KiCad files can be found in the schematics folder.
